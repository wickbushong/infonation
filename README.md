# Infonation

Welcome to infonation. A simple tool that provides users with general information about countries of their choosing.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'infonation'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install infonation

## Usage

To get set up fork and clone this repository then run ruby lib/run in your terminal/console once you have opened the directory that it's stored in. Once the app is up and running it will prompt the user with directions. The flow is pretty straightforward: You enter a country name, the app finds a corresponding country, or lists countries that are relevant to your search, then the app prompts you to ask for a specific category of information. The user can also ask to see all of the stored information for a country.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
